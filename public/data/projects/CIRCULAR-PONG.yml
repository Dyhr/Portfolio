  Online circular pong with up to 7 players.
desc: "Online circular pong with up to 7 players. Based on
  the classic game Pong, but on a circular playing field. The online component still
  works, even if it is laggy, but there aren't any AI opponent to practice against.\n
  There are several ways to tweak your game experience including game type, ball
  and player speed and more.\nYou're properly gonna need some friends to play it
  however."
