  Asymmetric survival board game about ghosts and stuff
desc: "\n<h1>Pitch</h1>\nIn B<i>asement of The Spirits</i>, players
  control spirits that possess members of the Robertson family. As the Robertsons
  is a family of experienced ghost hunters, it is difficult for the players to control
  the possessed family members. Players have to draw cards in order to control the
  vessels that they are currently possessing, while avoiding another spirit to possess
  them and thereby leaving them without a vessel, vulnerable to the mysteries of
  the basement.\n<h1>Narrative</h1>\nThe Robertson family is known for being a family
  of explorers. They delve into any kind of stuff of occult and supernatural. Some
  even call them ghost hunters, and spirit whisperers. The family consisting of
  Old Father John, Mother Wanda the wonky and little Tommy tip-toe had heard of
  a house infested by strong spirits. There were many urban legends of these spirits
  living in the basement of the house. Legends of how they were murderous spirits
  longing for blood and mayhem. Stories of people entering the basement and being
  possessed to never return to the land of the light again. John, Wanda and Tommy
  were not afraid though. They was a happy family and thought all spirits were misunderstood,
  and just wanted to live in coexistence with humans. But as they all said, if shit
  really went down, Father John had his old rifle, little Tommy was quick and could
  just run away and Mother Wanda was so hideously ugly that no one would ever possess
  her.\nTherefore when entering The Basement of The Spirits, as it was known for,
  they all thought themselves very safe, but oh boy are they wrong!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n
  The Robertsons has decided to enter <i>The Basement of The Spirits</i>. They all
  think they are very safe, but oh boy are they wrong!\n<h1>Rules:</h1>\n<h2><span
