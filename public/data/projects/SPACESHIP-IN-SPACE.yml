  A single-player, strategy-focused space simulator with a focus on
  resource management
desc: "A single-player, strategy-focused space simulator with a focus on
  resource management. You are tasked with upkeeping an old and damaged spaceship
  by distributing power to different machines and repairing broken instruments,
  thus being able to burn fuel, reaching the destination and completing the chosen
  delivery job.\n\nYou will earn an income for each completed job, with which they
  may buy items from a store, such as more fuel, repair tools, and cassette tapes.
  In the spaceship, you are accompanied by the ship's AI, which will provide
  the you with, not always useful, tips and information.\n\nThe core gameplay consists
  of resource management, in the form of power distribution and management of the
  provided equipment; batteries, air tanks and repair tools, as well as maintaining
  the planned route by burning fuel at the correct time.\n\nThrough power distribution,
  you will have to favor some ship function over others, as the ship will never
  have enough power for all systems. During the game, you will be challenged by
  different dangers, which will threaten the trip and your survival. For instance,
  meteoroid collisions, which will result in broken instruments. You may consult
  the AI and/or the diagnostics system, in order to gain awareness of the status
  of the ship, which in turn will help you decide on their next move."
