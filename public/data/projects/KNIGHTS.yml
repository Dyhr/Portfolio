  Fight to the death
desc: "Fight to the death. <em><strong>Y</strong></em><b><i>ou're
  knights who fight at the bottom of a\_volcano. Now the time is running out and
  the vulcano is collapsing and the\_platforms moving around. Quickly kill your
  opponents while avoiding the magma!</i></b>\n\nWhen players enter the level -
  Then the platforms will start to shift and new \"islands\" will appear. The players
  shall in this time try to avoid the collapsing (Jittering!) islands, and jump
  onto new ones. Al though, while still being able to kill &amp; block the other
  players. The last to survive the level wins, and the round restarts.\n\nControls
  are the following:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Left Analog Stick - Movement</li>\n \t<li>Button
  A - Attacking / Join Game</li>\n \t<li>Button B - Blocking</li>\n \t<li>Button
  X - Jumping</li>\n \t<li>Start - Start Game</li>\n</ul>\nThe Controls have been
  made in mind of playing from 2-4 players, each with their own Microsoft Xbox Controller
  attached to the Computer running the Game.\n\nWhen first entering the game you
  will be greeted by a Screen saying \"Get Ready, Knights!\". The players who want
  to join press A to toggle their Player on the screen - Here they can also see
  which colour they are. When ready, then any player press \"Start\" button on his/her
  controller to start the game. And the game begins.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMade for Unge
