  Evolve to become the very best
desc: "Evolve to become the very best. Like no one ever was. Not a very functional
  game. Mostly toys around with the idea of modular player upgrades. You get random
  upgrades after every level, depending on your performance. The idea was to have
  more choice and bigger bosses, but it never made it in.


  Made for Ludum Dare 24."
