desc: "Play as an important ordinary businness man,
  that needs to leave your apartment on time, but not before you've had your morning
  coffee, gotten dressed, fed your cat, and whatever else you want to waste your
  time on. Your coffe maker also appears to be broken so you'll have to figure
  out an alternative. Watch your stress though, as it might become a problem if
  you don't take time to relax.\n\nMade for the Global Game Jam 2016\n
