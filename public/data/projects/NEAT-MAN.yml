  An artificial neural network that plays Pacman
desc: "An artificial neural network that plays Pacman, using
  the NEAT algorithm. Using incremental evolution decent results can be achieved
  fairly quickly. The implementation however has memory leaks and are only able
  to evolve for a few hundred generations on common computers.\n\nSee the Github
  page for information on running it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMade for the course Artificial
  Life and Evolutionary Robotics at the IT University of Copenhagen.\n\nGroup members:\n
